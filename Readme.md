# Predicting-Molecular-Properties
Currently, Kaggle is holding a competition on prediction of molecular properties. The goal of the project is to do a prediction of scalar coupling costant (I've no clue what it is, even my wife who has Phd in Chemistry), but that is the beauty of machine learning. Even though, I'm not familar with the theory of it, I can still participate and work on the project.
I've started a python notebook to implement various models. As the trained and test data is above 25MB, please download it from the below link,

Also, I've used python 3.6 and mentioned all the required repositories in requirement.txt
